Modified 24 October 2005 by Nick Gammon.

  1. Changed use of "abs" to "fabs"
  2. Changed inclues from math.h and time.h to fmath and ftime
  3. Rewrote DoMin and DoMax to inline the computation because of some problems with some libraries.
  4. Removed "using namespace std;" and put "std::" in front of std namespace names where appropriate
  5. Removed MAKE_STRING macro and inlined the functionality where required.
  6. Changed Evaluate function to take its argument by reference.

Modified 13 January 2010 by Nick Gammon.
 
  1. Changed getrandom to work more reliably (see page 2 of discussion thread)
  2. Changed recognition of numbers to allow for .5 (eg. "a + .5" where there is no leading 0)
     Also recognises -.5 (so you don't have to write -0.5)
  3. Fixed problem where (2+3)-1 would not parse correctly (- sign directly after parentheses)
  4. Fixed problem where changing a parameter and calling p.Evaluate again would fail because the 
     initial token type was not reset to NONE.
